## What It Does

Doubles the weight on a single arm and further activates the core for stability.

## How to Do It

Just like it sounds—perform a push-up with one arm centered below your chest and the unweighted arm behind your pack. This one takes a bit more balance; it helps to keep your feet wider. Maintain a flat back and level hips (don’t let them twist one way or the other) throughout the movement. If you want an added challenge, opt for a two-point push-up: assume a standard push-up position with wide feet, then raise the opposite hand and leg to form a two-point plank. While maintaining a rigid plank, perform a push-up. Keep your back flat and hips level throughout the movement.

### Even More Modifications

Many of these moves can be made easier or harder with these modifications, although not every modification will work with every type of push-up.

#### Make It Easier

- **Knees**: Perform push-ups on your knees instead of your feet to ease the difficulty on your upper body.
  This is a great way to build up to more difficult variations.
- **Incline**: Elevate your hands on a bench, chair, or table—the higher above your feet, the easier.
- **Negatives**: Utilize the lowering phase of a push-up (when muscle fibers elongate under load).
  “Muscles can handle a heavier load under eccentric contraction than they can under concentric contraction,” says Scott Johnston, a master coach at Uphill Athlete and the co-author of Training for the New Alpinism and Training for the Uphill Athlete. Therefore, he says, “[Negatives] are able to stress the muscle to a much higher degree, so you get a bigger strength-training effect.” In other words, if you’re not yet strong enough to do some of these push-up variations with proper form, perform only the eccentric phase (the lowering half) to build up strength for the concentric phase (the pushing-back-up half), when muscles shorten under load.

#### Make It Harder

- **Feet Stacked**: Cross one ankle over the other so only one foot is on the ground.
  This requires more core activation for stability.

- **Decline**: Elevate your feet on a box, bench, or step to increase the activation of
  the upper chest muscles and the front of the shoulders (anterior deltoids). The higher your feet, the more difficult.

- **Weighted**: Wear a weight vest or have a friend place a weight plate on your
  back for an added strength challenge.

- **Eccentric Push-Ups**: The benefits of the eccentric muscle phase are twofold. First,
  as stated above, negatives are a good way to build up to more difficult exercises. But because you can handle a heavier load under eccentric contraction, you can lower yourself slowly (over three to five seconds) to milk the eccentric phase for added training effect.

- **Weighted Negatives**: You can also add external weight during the eccentric phase for a
  greater strength-training effect. Start in a standard push-up position and have a friend place plate weights on your back. Lower yourself until your chest almost touches the floor (eccentric phase), and then have your friend remove the weight (or some of it) before you push back up (concentric phase).

- **Plyometric Combinations**: Transition between different types of push-ups. For example, go
  back and forth between narrow and wide hands or the fore and aft positions of staggered hands. Get creative.
