## What It Does

Strengthens the upper body and core, with more focus on the shoulders.

## How to Do It

Begin in a downward dog yoga position, with your feet and hands just wider
than shoulder width. Keep your hips high, heels low, and maintain the
inverted-V position as you bend your elbows and lower your head toward
the floor between your hands. Reverse the movement to the starting position for one repetition.
