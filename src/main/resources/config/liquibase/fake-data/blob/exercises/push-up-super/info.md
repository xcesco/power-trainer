## What It Does

Works the shoulders, triceps, and core and improves flexibility.

## How to Do It

Slowly swoop from downward dog to cobra pose: from the downward dog position,
bend your elbows and lower your nose to the floor between your hands, like a
pike push-up, but then, without rising, continue moving your torso forward to
slide your chin, chest, and then rib cage between your hands. As your ribs meet
your hands, begin to arc your head and torso upward. Continue this upward arc until
your arms are straight, hips are pressed toward the ground, and your back is
hyperextended in cobra pose. Reverse the movement exactly until youâ€™re back in downward dog.
