## What It Does

Develops power in the chest, triceps, and shoulders.

## How to Do It

From a standard push-up position, lower your chest until itâ€™s
slightly below the level of your bent elbow, and then push upward
with enough force so that your hands leave the ground by a few inches.

Land with soft elbows in push-up form and continue the lowering motion
toward the ground. Repeat. Make sure to keep your back flat and hips level throughout the movement.

**Claps (Harder)**: Once you get a handle on power push-ups,
you can progress the exercise by adding in claps, which require more power to achieve the necessary airtime. For regular clap push-ups, perform a power push-up but with even more upward force. While your hands are in the air, clap below your chest. Like before, land with soft elbows in push-up form and continue lowering until your chest is slightly below the level of your bent elbow. Repeat.

**Behind-the-Back Claps (Even Harder)**: Do the same exercise,
but clap behind your back instead of below your chest. Be careful not to bend at the hips (cheating), and watch your face on this one.

**Triple Claps (Hardest)**: Do the same exercise, but clap under
your chest, then behind your back, and then under your chest again, all before touching the ground.
