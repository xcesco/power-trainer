## What It Does

Strengthens the upper body and core, with more focus on the triceps.

## How to Do It

Begin in a plank position, with your hands together and angled inward
at 45 degrees so that your index fingers and thumbs touch to form a triangle
(or diamond). Keep your elbows tight to your body and bend them to lower your
chest toward the triangle. Reverse the movement to the starting position
for one repetition. Keep the triangle directly below your chest throughout the movement.
