## What It Does

Applies a higher percentage of body weight to a single arm, while the opposite arm assists
(a good way to build up to a one-arm push-up).

## How to Do It

Assume a push-up position, with wide hands angled outward at about 45 degrees.
Lower yourself at an angle to one side so that you bring your shoulder down to
your hand of the same side, while the other arm stretches to become fully extended.
(Itâ€™s okay if your hands pivot during the movement.) Push back up to reverse the
movement and return to the starting position. Repeat to the other side.

It might help to keep your feet wider.

Typewriter Push-Up: This variation is similar to the archer, but instead
of returning to the starting position between every push-up, move your chest from
side to side horizontally along and just above the ground, while fully extending
the opposite arm each time.
