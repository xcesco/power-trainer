## What It Does

Strengthens the upper body, with more focus on the core, hip flexors, and shoulders.

## How to Do It

Assume a standard push-up position. As you lower yourself to the ground,
simultaneously pick up one leg and cross it beneath your body as you rotate
your hip toward the ground. Reverse the movement to the starting position and repeat
on the other side.
