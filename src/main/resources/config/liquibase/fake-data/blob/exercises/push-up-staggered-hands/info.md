## What It Does

Trains the push-up muscles asymmetrically across the body and requires more core
activation for stability.

## How to Do It

From a standard push-up position, move one hand forward and the other backward so
theyâ€™re offset by about six to 12 inches (the farther, the more difficult).

Bend your elbows to lower your chest until it is slightly below the level of
your bent elbow, and then extend your elbows to push back up to the starting position.

Keep your elbows tight to your body throughout the movement. After one or more repetitions,
switch the fore and aft positions of your hands to work each side evenly.
