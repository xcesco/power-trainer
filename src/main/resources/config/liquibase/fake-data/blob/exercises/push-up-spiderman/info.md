## What It Does

Strengthens the core in addition to the typical push-up muscles.

## How to Do It

Assume a standard push-up position. As you lower yourself toward the ground,
simultaneously bring one knee out to the side and up to touch your elbow, with
your leg parallel to the ground. Your knee should touch your elbow at the lowest
point of the push-up. Reverse the movement to the starting position and repeat on the other side.
