## What It Does

Strengthens the upper body—primarily the chest, shoulders, and triceps—as well as the core
and back muscles.

## How to Do It

Start in a standard push-up position (as described above), with your feet together or no more
than 12 inches apart, hands flat on the ground below your shoulders, and arms straight.
Breathe in as you bend your elbows—keep them tracking back alongside your body—to lower
your chest to slightly below the level of your bent elbow, and then breathe out as you push
back up to the starting position for one repetition.
