## What It Does

Strengthens the upper body and core, with more focus on the pectoral muscles.

## How to Do It

Do a strict push-up, as described above, but with your hands farther out to
each side, roughly 2.5 to three feet apart (the farther apart, the more difficult).
Keep your elbows tracking back throughout the movement.
