## What It Does

Strengthens the upper body and core, with more focus on the triceps.

## How to Do It

Start in a plank position, with your forearms flat on the ground,
shoulder-width apart and parallel. Push up with your triceps to lift your
elbows off the ground; continue until your arms are fully extended, then lower your
elbows until just above the ground (donâ€™t weight your forearms again) for one repetition.

The farther forward you place your arms, the more difficult.
